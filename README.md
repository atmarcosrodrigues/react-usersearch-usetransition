# User Search Api - React useTransition

User search application using React 18 features. Consider an application where you render a huge list of users and a textbox to search any of the users by their names.

This application uses the [useTransition](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition) hook. It improves the application responsiveness by optimizing the performance.

To generate fictitious user data, we will use the library - [@faker-js/faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker)
